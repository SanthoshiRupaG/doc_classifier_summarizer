The Document Classifier is aiming to automatically assign predefined labels to different type of documents based on their content and a short summary on the content of the file. 
The problem lies in efficiently managing and organizing vast amounts of unstructured textual data, often leading to challenges in finding relevant information quickly. 
To address this, the proposed system leverages machine learning techniques to categorize documents into appropriate classes, enhancing searchability and reducing manual effort. 
The existing system relies heavily on manual tagging or rule-based approaches, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. 
The scope of this project extends to various industries, from news classification to academic paper sorting, improving efficiency in information organization and retrieval.
There are 4 classes in which the document categorize into : Politics,Games&sports,Business/Finance,Sci/Tech.
This system supports various file formats like doc,pdf, .txt file etc.
The .pkl files are trained models for document classifier and the system summarizes the content using nltk and tf-idf vectorization.
